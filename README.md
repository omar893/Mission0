Mission Ready HQ - Mission 0


This was my first time using bootstrap, I chose to use bootstrap because it looked very straight forward during Rams presentation.
Considering it was my first time using bootstrap and making a responsive application, I feel it went very well and I'm happy with the result.
I found it scary when it came to fixing any problems with the mobile version of the site because I focused on the web version first,
so changes to the mobile version would cause problems for the web version.

The problems with the mobile version being: > Search bar not stacking above the search button
                                            > Cards not centered

If I were to design a website using bootstrap again I would focus on the mobile version first, I think I remember Ram saying that is
how bootstrap is intended to be used.

I will try to recreate the website using react as it seems very interesting but I was not confident I could learn to use it in time.
